Markdown parsed.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/curvy` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
